See src/conversation.py and src/read_file_command.py.

In general, instances of MultilineContent should prefer NOT to include strings
with \n characters. Instead, they should just use multiple strings.

That is, instead of:

  ["foo\nbar\quux"]

We should do:

  ["foo", "bar", "quux"]

That's because it enables us to correctly compute the length (number of lines)
in the section (without having to look at the entire contents). This is
advantageous because some things want to default to showing/hiding sections
depending on their number of lines.

Can you fix src/read_file_command.py to properly do this? That is, to return a
list of lines (rather than a list with a single string with newline characters).
