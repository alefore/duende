Can you find callers of GetContentListStr and remove them (switch them to
GetContentSections)?

Take this as an opportunity to better handle the list of sections. For example,
you can now long how many sections there are.

While at it, also change AgentLoop.run to use a List[MultilineContent] for
messages_for_ai, where unrelated things (e.g., the output of different commands)
is added as separate sections.
