I want to improve src/static/agent.js and src/static/agent.css.

1. CSS: Can you put a thin/light border around each message section?

2. If a section is longer than 5 lines, it should start collapsed (force the user to expand it).

3. If a section is collapsed, let's still ensure the very first line in the section is shown, somehow.

4. If a section is collapsed and has more than 5 lines, somehow show the count of lines, something like: "(121 lines)" close to the expand link.

Can you implement these changes?
