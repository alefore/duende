Read src/static/agent.js.

Whenever the confirmation form is submitted, we should immediately assume that
no confirmation is required (and change the textarea visibility).

Can you modify src/static/agent.js to do that?

Avoid code duplication as much as possible; if needed, extract a new function.

While at it, can you change the behavior so that instead of fully hiding the
textarea (which makes things jittery), we just disable it (but it remains
visible, just empty)?
