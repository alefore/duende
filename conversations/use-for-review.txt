Look at how AgentLoop triggers code reviews after the AI claims to be done implementing a task (in function _HandleDoneCommand).

Can you add a command-line flag (to CreateCommonParser) which, if given, assumes that the code repository has implemented the feature (as given by --task) and we just want to trigger code review? Look at the existing flags and make a proposal for what you think is the best semantics. Bear in mind that we'll need to support three use cases:

1. Ask the AI to implement something (and don't do code reviews).
2. Ask the AI to implement something; and do code reviews.
3. Don't ask the AI to implement anything; just do code reviews (for existing change).

Before you start implementing this, can you tell me in plain English what you think would be the best possible implementation? Which function would you modify to hook this functionality? I will confirm explicitly.
