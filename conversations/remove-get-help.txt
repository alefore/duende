BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE, do this: #read_file src/agent_command.py

Your task: Find any subclasses of AgentCommand in src/git_commands.py. Rewrite
the `Syntax` method of any such classes such that the English text information
from the `GetHelp` method is included in the `description` field of the returned
`CommandSyntax`.

Do NOT include the information about the arguments syntax; that is already made
explicit in the structure returned by the `Syntax` method. Your task only
concerns the simple English-text description of what the command does.

Feel free to rewrite the description somewhat if you want to make sure it
references the appropriate names of arguments.

Good luck!
