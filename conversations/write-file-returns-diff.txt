Can you improve the implementation of WriteFileCommand so that the output includes a diff of the file before and after?

The diff should only be returned is it's less than 25 lines. Otherwise, include a summary of the diff (e.g. count of lines added, removed). Use whatever diff format you think is most useful for the AI applying changes.

Can you add two unit tests that validate this?

#read_file src/write_file_command.py
