For context, start with: #read_file src/agent_command.py

Can you create a new file src/validate_command_input.py with a function like this:

  def ValidateCommandInput(syntax : CommandSyntax, input: CommandInput) -> List[str]:
    ...

It should return a list of strings with warnings when it detects errors.

This command should make sure that command_input fully matches the expectations
of the syntax. Things to check:

* Are all required arguments provided?

* Does the multiline behavior match?

* Are more arguments given than the command accepts?

Possibly other checks that you can come up with.

Make sure to print the errors with as much detail as possible, since they will
be given to an AI model. So, for example, omit an error for every specific
condition (rather than more general errors).
