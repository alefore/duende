Compare ResetFileCommand with WriteFileCommand. WriteFileCommand correctly calls into the validation_manager to register changes. Can you change ResetFileCommand to *also* call into validation_manager when at least one file is reset?

#read_file src/write_file_command.py
#read_file src/git_commands.py
#read_file src/validation.py
