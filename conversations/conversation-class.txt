To get context about this task, start with commands:

  #read_file src/agent_loop.py

Introduce a module src/conversation.py with classes Conversation and Message to
represent a conversation with the ai. That class should help us ensure that
messages are only added to the conversation (never removed or modified).

DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILES OTHER THAN src/conversation.py. Just add the new
src/conversation.py file. In a previous attempt to adjust callers, you failed
horribly and started randomly deleting code. I will figure out how to hook it in
a follow up step.

Requirements:

* The Message class should contain two string fields: who sent it, and the
contents.

* The conversation class should have methods: Load Save AddMessage
GetMessagesList.

* Add static type annotations to all methods.

* There should not be any OpenAI or ChatGPT-specific logic in
src/conversation.py. This should be fully decoupled.
