Can you add to each message a timestamp with the instant in which it was generated? Call this field `creation_time`.

Feel free to break reading of previously saved conversations (that's not important). In other words, do not extend the code to deal with loading messages without this timestamp.

Store it (in Serialize) in the most standard way you can think of.
Note that we will attempt to send the output of Serialize through socketio to the browser.

Make sure it is stored in UTC format, without local timezone information.
