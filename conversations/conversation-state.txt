Can you add to Conversatoin a field current_state?

It should take a value from an enum of valid states you'll add in src/conversation_state.py, representing what the Conversation is currently doing.

Values should include:

* Starting (has been created but nothing else has happened).
* Waiting for a response from AI
* Waiting for review feedback (from a nested conversations)
* Running commands received from AI
* Parsing commands received from AI
* Executing implicit validation (between commands)

We may extend it in the future.
