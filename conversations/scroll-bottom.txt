See src/static/agent.js.

When the user presses Shift+Enter, the confirmation textarea grows dynamically
(vertically) to accomodate the new line. That's great.

Can you figure out a way to make sure that the screen stays fully scrolled to
the bottom? I think we can't do that directly in the input handler (because the
textarea gets expanded *after* the input is processed, which is after the
handler has returned).
