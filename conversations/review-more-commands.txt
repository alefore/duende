Can you add more relevant commands to the CommandRegistry created by CreateReviewCommandRegistry?

Compare it with the default command registry (from CreateCommandRegistry) and copy any commands that you think may be relevant for the AI that is in charge of doing a code review.

I think you'll need to pass more parameters to CreateReviewCommandRegistry (so that you can create the relevant commands). You'll need to modify the caller, which you can find with #validate (the errors should help you find it).

Good luck!
