Before doing anything else, do this:

#read_file src/validate_command_input.py
#select_python _execute_commands

We've implemented ValidateCommandInput that receives a command's expected syntax
and an actual invocation to the command. It returns warnings if the arguments
don't match the expectations.

Can you modify _execute_commands to validate the commands?

To get the syntax of a command (as returned from the command_registry), you can
do:

  command.Syntax()

If ValidateCommandInput returns any warnings, add them to the output (and don't
run the command).

While at it, if you can simplify _execute_commands, that may be worth it. It's
not particularly elegant.
