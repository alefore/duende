This behavior is problematic because the `SelectCommand` expects to handle \"No match found\" for such cases by checking if `selection.start_index is None`.\n\nInstead of raising a generic error, modify the end of the `from_line_patterns` method to explicitly return `cls(path, None, None)` if `start_index` is `None` after iterating through all lines. This will allow the calling `SelectCommand` to handle the \"No match found\" scenario gracefully, consistent with its current error handling logic.\n\n**Proposed change:**\n\n```diff\n--- a/src/selection_manager.py\n+++ b/src/selection_manager.py\n@@ -96,7 +96,11 @@ class Selection:\n -    if end_index is None:\n +    # This case should only be reached if end_line_pattern was not None but was not found\n -      raise ValueError(\"End pattern not found.\")\n +    if start_index is None:\n +      # No start pattern was found, return a selection indicating no match.\n +      return cls(path, None, None)\n +    elif end_line_pattern is not None:\n +      # Start pattern was found, but end pattern was not found (for a range selection).\n +      raise ValueError(\"End pattern not found.\")\n -\n -    return cls(path, start_index, end_index)\n +    # This else branch should theoretically be unreachable if all logical paths are covered,\n +    # meaning an internal logic error if hit.\n +    raise ValueError(\"Internal error: Unexpected state in pattern matching logic.\")\n```\n#end\n#done"

        "#suggest <<\nThe current implementation of `Selection.from_line_patterns` in `src/selection_manager.py` attempts to handle both single-line and range selections, and their respective \"not found\" cases, within a single loop and a complex conditional structure at the end. This approach has a few issues:\n\n1.  **Potential `UnboundLocalError`**: If `start_line_pattern` is found, but `end_line_pattern` is specified and not found, the variable `end_index` would never be assigned, leading to an `UnboundLocalError` when the code tries to `return cls(path, start_index, end_index)` after the loop (as the original code does, or if a `break` were re-introduced). The current diff's final block also doesn't correctly handle `start_index is None` resulting in a generic `ValueError`.\n2.  **Lack of Clarity**: The single loop trying to identify both start and end patterns, along with the special `if end_line_pattern is None` check, makes the flow difficult to follow and prone to subtle bugs.\n3.  **Inconsistent Error Handling**: If the `start_line_pattern` is not found, the current diff's `from_line_patterns` method will raise `ValueError(\"Unexpected error in pattern matching.\")` instead of returning `cls(path, None, None)`, which `SelectCommand` expects to signify \"No match found\".\n\nTo improve clarity, robustness, and correct error handling for all scenarios (single pattern, range pattern, pattern(s) found, pattern(s) not found), I suggest refactoring this method into a more sequential, two-pass approach: first find the start line, then (if applicable) find the end line. This separates concerns and simplifies the logic.\n\n**Proposed change:**\n\n```diff\n--- a/src/selection_manager.py\n+++ b/src/selection_manager.py\n@@ -78,25 +78,31 @@ class Selection:\n                       end_line_pattern: Optional[str]) -> 'Selection':\n     \"\"\"Creates a Selection object based on line patterns using regex.\n     If end_line_pattern is None, only the start line is selected.\"\"\"\n     with open(path, 'r') as f:\n       lines = f.readlines()\n \n-    start_index = None\n-\n-    for i, line in enumerate(lines):\n-      if start_index is None and re.search(start_line_pattern, line):\n-        start_index = i\n-        if end_line_pattern is None:\n-          # If no end pattern, select only the start line\n-          return cls(path, start_index, start_index)\n-      elif start_index is not None and end_line_pattern is not None and re.search(\n-          end_line_pattern, line):\n-        end_index = i\n-        return cls(path, start_index, end_index)\n+    start_index: Optional[int] = None\n+    end_index: Optional[int] = None\n \n-    # This case should only be reached if end_line_pattern was not None but was not found\n-    if end_line_pattern is not None:\n-      raise ValueError(\"End pattern not found.\")\n-\n-    # Fallback, though the return cls(path, start_index, start_index) above should handle the None case\n-    raise ValueError(\"Unexpected error in pattern matching.\")\n+    # 1.

To ensure robust error handling for all scenarios, it's crucial to add test cases for when patterns *do not* match any lines in the file. These tests should verify that `SelectCommand` correctly processes `Selection(path, None, None)` (returned by `Selection.from_line_patterns` in the proposed refactor) and other error conditions by returning appropriate error messages in `command_output.errors`, rather than crashing or providing an empty/incorrect selection.\n\n**Proposed additional tests for `src/test_select_commands.py`:**\n\n```python\n  def testSelect_singlePattern_noMatch(self):\n    command_input = CommandInput(\n        'select', arguments=['test_file_no_match.txt', 'NonExistent Line'])\n\n    with open(\"test_file_no_match.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n      f.write(\"Line 1\\n\")\n      f.write(\"Line 2\\n\")\n\n    command_output = self.select_literal_cmd.Execute(command_input)\n    self.assertIn(\"No match found for pattern 'NonExistent Line'\", command_output.errors)\n    self.assertEqual(len(command_output.output), 0)\n    self.assertIsNone(self.selection_manager.get_selection())\n\n  def testSelect_rangePattern_noStartMatch(self):\n    command_input = CommandInput(\n        'select', arguments=['test_file_range_no_start.txt', 'No Start', 'End'])\n\n    with open(\"test_file_range_no_start.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n      f.write(\"Line 1\\n\")\n      f.write(\"Line 2 containing End\\n\")\n\n    command_output = self.select_literal_cmd.Execute(command_input)\n    self.assertIn(\"No match found for pattern 'No Start'\", command_output.errors)\n    self.assertEqual(len(command_output.output), 0)\n    self.assertIsNone(self.selection_manager.get_selection())\n\n  def testSelect_rangePattern_noEndMatch(self):\n    command_input = CommandInput(\n        'select', arguments=['test_file_range_no_end.txt', 'Start Line', 'No End'])\n\n    with open(\"test_file_range_no_end.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n      f.write(\"This is a Start Line\\n\")\n      f.write(\"Middle line\\n\")\n      f.write(\"Another line\\n\")\n\n    command_output = self.select_literal_cmd.Execute(command_input)\n    # This error message comes from the ValueError raised by from_line_patterns\n    self.assertIn(\"End pattern not found for the selection range.\", command_output.errors)\n    self.assertEqual(len(command_output.output), 0)\n    self.assertIsNone(self.selection_manager.get_selection())\n```\n#end\n#suggest <<\nThe changes in `src/select_commands.py` correctly introduce `Optional[str]` for `end_line_pattern_raw` and handle its conditional assignment and escaping. These modifications are well-aligned with supporting single-pattern selections and correctly pass `None` to the `Selection.from_line_patterns` method when only one pattern is provided. No further changes are specifically suggested for this file, assuming the proposed refactor in `selection_manager.py` is adopted.\n#end\n#done"
