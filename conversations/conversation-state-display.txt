We've extended the socketio messages that the server sends to the client (function WebServerState.SendUpdate) to include a `conversation_state` field with a string describing what the conversation is waiting for.

Can you extend the method in JS that receives those updates (handleUpdate) to somehow display the state? You'll need to tweak the HTML as well.

Maybe the best way to display the state is:

- If the state is as WAITING_FOR_CONFIRMATION, don't display anything.
  This means the human is looking at it, most likely.
  (Or will realize it through the changes to the confirmation textarea.

- Otherwise: hide the confirmation <Textarea> (instead of what we do currently, which is to disable it) and, instead, display a label with the state.
