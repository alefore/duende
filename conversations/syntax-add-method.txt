Start with: #read_file src/agent_command.py

Look for all subclasses of `AgentCommand` in src/write_file_command.py. For each, add a method that looks like this:

It should look like this:

  @classmethod
  def Syntax(self) -> CommandSyntax:
    ... implementation ...

Make sure you:

* Add `Syntax` *above* (before) `Execute`.

* Use `CommandSyntax` as defined in src/agent_command.py. Don't just hallucinate
it.

* Be careful with the values you use for ArgumentContentType (use the most
specific possible value (i.e., don't just use STRING for things that are
paths!)).

* Also make sure to use `repeatable_final` if the last argument
can be repeated.

To avoid problems, just write the output in one pass with #write_file.
Immediately after writing, you can issue a #validate command.
