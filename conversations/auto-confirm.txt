I would like to add a toggle at the top of the HTML view with a checkbox:
"Automatic confirmation".

It should always be visible (this may need tricky adjustments to the HTML so
that the conversation continues to scroll to the bottom, but this stays visible)
and, by default, not be checked.

If it's checked, whenever a confirmation is requested, we should immediately
respond with an empty confirmation (and maybe console.log this).
