Take a look at the tests for AgentLoop. Can you implement a test for the do_review functionality? It should kick in three nested reviews.

You will probably need to extend various files to support this. For example, it's possible that the FakeConversationalAI class will need to be extended to support multiple conversations.

Feel free to read any other files you may want to get context about.

It's possible this will uncover bugs. Who knows!
