The function EnsureGitRepoIsClean has a very ugly interface, it does two things:

- Check if we are inside a git repos.
- If we are, and the repo is not clean, crash.

Can you improve the interface? Ideally, this function just checks the state and returns a value from an enum, identifying which is the current situation:

1. We are NOT inside a git repository.
2. We are inside a git repository, and it is clean.
3. We are inside a git repository, but it is not clean.

Can you change the interface? Maybe rename the function to something more
meaningful, like CheckGitRepositoryState.

This implies changing the callers (I think there's only one) to handle the
crashing (if the repository is not clean) at the call site.
