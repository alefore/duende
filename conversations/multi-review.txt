Change AgentLoop's review functionality to support many parallel review conversations.

It should get a list of files inside agent/review/*.txt (instead of looking at agent/review.txt). For each match, the "parent" AgentLoop (where do_review is true) should start a separate nested "review" AgentLoop, using the contents of the file as an input to the prompt (where currently agent/review.txt is used).

All the nested loops should run in parallel, so probably each needs to run in it's own thread.

The parent conversation should only continue when all child reviews are done, aggregating their suggestions.

Please put all the review-related logic in file src/review_utils.py (try to leave AgentLoop small, it's already fairly big).

To avoid circular dependencies:

1. Move AgentLoopOptions to a separate module src/agent_loop_options.py (and remove it from src/agent_loop.py).

2. Update all dependencies of AgentLoopOptions to import from the new location.

3. src/review_utils.py can depend on AgentLoopOptions, but shouldn't see AgentLoop. Instead, it should receive a Callable[[AgentLoopOptions], None] that internally creates *and* runs the corresponding agent loop.

Do not include TYPE_CHECKING.
