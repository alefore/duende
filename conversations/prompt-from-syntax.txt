Before you do anything else, do this:

#read_file src/agent_command.py
#select_python CommandRegistry

Your task is to change the `HelpText` method of class `CommandRegistry` to avoid
calling the `GetDescription` method of the individual command instances (which I
want to remove). Instead, we should call the `Syntax` method, which includes the
same information but in a much better format.

Maybe let's create a function in a new file src/agent_command_helpers.txt with
this interface:

  def HelpText(syntax : CommandSyntax) -> str
     """Renders a help string corresponding to the `syntax` object."""
     ...

Then CommandRegistry's `HelpText` simply uses that function to turn a
`CommandSyntax` instance into something like:

#some_command path [pattern] [flag...] <<
multiline description (this info comes from the multiline.description)…
…
#end
  Command some_command does blah blah blah (this info comes from CommandSyntax.description).

Note in the above how I handled required arguments ("path" in this example),
optional parameters ("pattern" in this example) and the repeatable_final
argument ("flag" in the example).
