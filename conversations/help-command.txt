Can you add a help command? It should optionally receive a list of commands as arguments and show more information about them.

Once implemented, the command needs to be added to the commands-registry.

Maybe implement it in src/help_command.py

This should simply output the result of calling the existing RenderHelpText function.

You can see an example command in src/read_file_command.py.

#read_file src/command_registry.py
#search RenderHelpText
#read_file src/read_file_command.py
