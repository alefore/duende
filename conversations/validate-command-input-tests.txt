Please read src/validate_command_input.py and give me a list of unit tests to
add for ValidateCommandInput that cover the majority of situations.

You'll probably also want to read files src/agent_command.py and
src/file_access_policy.py.

In your tests, prefer using real instances of FileAccessPolicy (rather than
mocks).
