See src/agent_server.py, src/web_server_state.py and src/static/agent.js.

Currently there's a race condition where when a new message arrives:

1. The server may start sending the new message to the client.
2. The client may by coincidence request new messages (stating how many it currently has, which doesn't yet include the new message).
3. The server may re-send the message to the client.

Could you propose in English an approach to fix this problem? Ideally, if the
same message is sent multiple times, the client will correctly handle the race
condition (and ignore the 2nd update).
