Read src/agent_server.py, src/static/agent.js and src/web_server_state.py for context.

Imagine that the user had the page loaded in a previous run of agent_server and
the server is restarted with a new task (and thus a new conversation).

When this happens, we should clear the messages already in the page!

So I propose that WebServerState should generate a random string (maybe of
length 20) at start and include that key in every message. The JavaScript code
should remember the key and, if the key changes, should remove all elements from  the <div id=conversation>.
