          "The code changes successfully address the prompt by modifying `ExtractCommands` to accept a list of strings (representing multiline content) and updating its callers to pass this format, thereby eliminating unnecessary `join` calls. The test cases have also been updated correctly.\n\nHere are a few suggestions for improvement:\n\n#suggest <<\nThe `TODO` comment regarding changing `ExtractCommands` to receive `MultilineContent` directly should be removed from `src/agent_loop.py`. The current change effectively addresses this by having `ExtractCommands` receive a `List[str]`, which is the direct representation of multiline content, and the `MultilineContent` class does not exist in the codebase.\n#end\n\n#suggest <<\nIn `src/agent_loop.py`, the `response_lines` variable is created from flattening `response_message.GetContentSections()`. It might be beneficial to encapsulate this logic into a helper method of `response_message` or a utility function if `GetContentSections()` always returns an iterable of objects where `s.content` is a `List[str]`. This would improve readability and potentially reusability if this pattern appears elsewhere. For example: `response_message.GetAllLines()` or similar. However, for just one usage, the current list comprehension is acceptable. This is a minor stylistic suggestion.\n#end\n\n#done"
