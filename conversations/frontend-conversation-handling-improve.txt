When the frontend JS code receives new data from a conversation, it should NOT switch to it. It should keep a conversationIdToState dictionary registering the states of each conversation (indexed by ConversationId, contents are the data.conversation_state received by handleListConversations and handleUpdate. These two functions should call an updateConversationState method that with the conversationId and conversation state. That method should:

1. Update the conversationIdToState.
2. If the conversationId received is the one currently shown, then update the HTML view.

The code that updates the view should be moved to its own function (displayConversationState(conversationState)). That code should be called both from updateConversationState and from showConversation.
