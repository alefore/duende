I suspect #select with a single pattern (i.e., no end pattern) is buggy.

Can you add tests and verify? If it is buggy, please fix the implementation.

Perhaps try with some smallish (say ~5 lines) file and select something in the middle.

#read_file src/select_commands.py
#read_file src/test_select_commands.py
