Can you extend CommandRegistry to ensure that `Get` will find methods by alias? In other words, it should not only find commands given their Name, but also any of their aliases.

The keys in `commands` should continue to be ONLY the names (otherwise `list_all` will contain repetitions). So probably worth creating a separate table mapping aliases to real names.

Please also throw a custom exception on Register if there's a clash (of either aliases/names).
