If no end pattern is provided, only the line matching the start pattern is selected. The contents selected will be returned. Use select_overwrite to overwrite the selection with new contents.

Searches all Python files if no path is given.\n\n#replace_python identifier [path] <<\nThe new definition of the Python element.\n\u2026\n#end\n  Replaces the definition of the identifier in the specified Python file. Searches in all Python files if no path is provided. The identifier can be the name of a (top-level) function, class, or method.\n\n#task [task_name] <<\nThe specification for the task.\n\u2026\n#end\n  Starts a new conversation with the AI asking it to implement a sub-task.
