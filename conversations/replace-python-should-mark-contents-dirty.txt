Look at src/write_file_command.py to see an example of how the validation
manager is updated when there's a change (`RegisterChange`).

Can you check src/replace_python_command.py to confirm that when a file is
updated, ReplacePythonCommand correctly calls into
validation_manager.RegisterChange? If it doesn't (which I suspect), can you fix
it? You may need to adjust customers to pass the validation manager (in case it
isn't already passed).
