See src/web_server_state.py, src/agent_server.py and src/static/agent.js for
context.

We are foolishly assuming that the server can remember how many messages have
been sent to the web view. This doesn't work for a few reasons:

1. The web view may be reloaded. So the server's count is now incorrect.

2. There may be more than one server view, so we will likely clash.

Can you change the communication between client and server so that the client
communicates how many messages it has?

So the SendUpdate method should receive the count. That means that the JS client
needs to send this data (count of messages) as part of the `request_update`
socket message.
