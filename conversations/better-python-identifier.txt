Can you look at src/select_python.py and improve the implementation of
FindPythonDefinition to support identifiers like Foo.Bar? This should match the
method Bar in the class Foo.

Make sure to support multiple (arbitrary) levels of nesting.

Try hard to make your implementation as simple as possible.
