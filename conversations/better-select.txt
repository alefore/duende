Thinking of the semantics of #select and #select_overwrite, can you suggest
improvements that would make them easier to use more robustly by you? I've found
that the AI often struggles with them (for example, sends patterns that don't
match anything due to Regex special characters; or issues the select overwrite
with the wrong level of indentation (for python files)). As a result, I often
end up telling the AI to stop using #select entirely. I want to make them as
easy to use as possible.
