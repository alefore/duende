For context, start with:
#read_file src/args_common.py
#read_file src/command_registry.py
#read_file src/git_commands.py

When this program starts, if it is running in a git repository with uncommitted
changes, it crashes (to warn the user).

Your task is to define a boolean command-line argument that, when given, allows
the program to ignore this condition. In that case, it should conditionally log
an info statement like: Git repository is dirty; ignoring due to command-line
flag --git-dirty-accept.
