The parsing logic (see src/validate_command_input.py) now directly performs various validations for inputs that are declared as:

      ArgumentContentType.PATH_INPUT,
      ArgumentContentType.PATH_INPUT_OUTPUT,
      ArgumentContentType.PATH_OUTPUT

This was done *after* many commands (implementations of class AgentCommand,
defined in src/agent_command.py) had added their own validations. These
command-specific validations are now redundant.

Can you scan the code and find sub-classes of AgentCommand that have redundant
validations that we could remove?
