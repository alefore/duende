Read the following files:
* src/agent_loop.py
* src/args_common.py
* src/conversation.py
* src/agent_server.py
* src/web_server_state.py

Every time the AgentLoop adds a new message to the conversation, we should
notify the browser. To do this, we should ensure that the method SendUpdate in
class WebServerState is executed.

Can you make a proposal for how to propagate that signal? What do you think
would be the cleanest way?

Perhaps we can register listeners on the conversation, perhaps when it gets
constructed? We would have to propagate the callback that does it through
CreateAgentLoopOptions.

But maybe there's a different approach that's cleaner?
