Can you add to src/conversation.py a class MultilineContent that is,
essentially, an alias for List[str]?

Can you then change the Message class to:

1. Remove the `content` field
2. Add a private field `_content_sections` with a List[MultilineContent]
3. Add a method `GetContentListStr()` that just concatenates all sections into a single `List[str]` and returns it.
4. Add a method `GetContentSections()` that just returns the value of `_content_sections`.
5. Add a method `PushSection(self, MultilineContent)` that appends a new section.
5. Change the `Save` and `Load` methods if needed. It is okay to lose the ability to load previous conversations, it doesn't matter.

And then change all customers of the Message class to deal with the new API.

This is a large change, so let's do it in two passes: first do all the changes
to src/conversation.py; and then start changing customers. Maybe change
customers one-by-one.
