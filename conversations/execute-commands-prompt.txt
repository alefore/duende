See src/args_common.py and src/parsing.py and src/command_registry.py and maybe
even src/agent_loop.py.

When creating the initial prompt (in `LoadOrCreateConversation`), maybe run
ExtractCommands in the contents of the --task file and execute any commands you
find. Send to the AI all non_command lines (as returned by ExtractCommands) and,
for all commands found, execute them and send their output to the AI.

This will let the user directly put commands there, rather than having to ask
the AI to execute those commands.
