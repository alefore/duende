Can you look at src/agent_server.py and src/static/agent.css and improve the
HTML layout so that the confirmation text becomes a textarea? It should exapnd
horizontally to fit the entirety of the screen and, ideally, also grows
automatically vertically as the user enters multiple lines.

Instead of a confirmation button, the info should be submitted when the user
presses Enter (as long as the server is waiting for confirmation; otherwise the
Enter press should be ignored). Pressing Shift+Enter should start a new line.

Good luck!
