Review task: Try to avoid code with side-effects (e.g., assignment) when the same thing can be achieved in immutable ways. Obviously, don't take this to the extreme (i.e., pay attentio to how complex the implementation is).

For example, instead of:

  output = []
  for x in ComputeList():
    output.append(x * 2)
  output.append(5)

Prefer something like:

  output = [x * 2 for x in ComputeList()] + [5]
