Review task: Identify places in any Python code that was added where static type annotations can be added, in ways that enable mypy to detect type mismatches statically.

In general, all Python functions and variables should have a type annotation.

An exception to this may be variables where the type is very evident from the context (as long as mypy can infer it).

If the change does NOT add any Python code, this requirement is automatically satisfied.
